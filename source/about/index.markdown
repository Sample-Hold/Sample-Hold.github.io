I was about 12 when I wrote my first program.




Me and a few friends have been that kind of foolish kids constantly breaking their toys to see what's inside, with ideas in mind so as to rebuilt them in a very different way. We didn't know that a few years later, this obsession would turn into an "every-day" skill to help us compete with all the programming challenges we would meet during our career as software developers.




I'm Fred Ghilini and I'm 30. I've got a ten years experience as a developer and I also dedicated my last two years to project management. I usually work for the Internet industry, but I spend a lot of free time investigating software development on Windows and Mac OS X in order to satisfy one of my main hobbies which is computer music.




As I said above, I often need to dig things further by involving myself into side-projects, sometimes in a "test-and-learn" manner, to achieve my goals in Computer Science. So I decided to run this blog to draft out my work into articles and tutorials.




I intent to write on various topics related to programming and web development, but for a start we'll focus on computer music and audio programming, hoping that it helps anybody looking for this kind of tutorials on the Web. Please consider every article as a "permanent draft" that may or may not provide the best advice for an issue, and may possibly contain mistakes. That's where you come into account : you must never hesitate to give your personal feedback by commenting my articles or even contacting me by email. By sharing our knowledge we'll improve everything : you can link to my articles as I will possibly link to yours so as not to rewrite on things already debated.




You may contact me from my [fredguile at gmail] account. I'll be happy to hear anything you have in your mind about me or the stuffs presented in this blog.


**Fred Ghilini.**
