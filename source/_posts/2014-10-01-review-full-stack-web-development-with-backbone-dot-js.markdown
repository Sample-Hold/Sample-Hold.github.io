{% img alignleft http://pipefishbook.com/images/buch_gross.png %} In my current assignments, I'm aimed at contributing to an enterprise-scaled Single-Page Application using Backbone.js, a very popular library used in many frontend projects. Many developers would argue that Backbone.js isn't the easiest way to start your application, since it requires you to build up the proper stack of technologies and libraries to address each topic encountered during frontend development. Some would prefer choosing a more integrated framework like AngularJS or Ember. On the pros side, Backbone.js is agnostic with respect of your preferred libraries and coupling it with the right ones leads to a truly efficient solution given you initial concerns, whether it be optimizing your SPA for mobile devices, desktops, or tailoring your solution for a specific server-side technology.

During my researches I was aimed to read "Full Stack Web Development With Backbone.js" and share practices with the author, Patrick Mulder, which is a Munich-based freelance software consultant. For anyone who was looking at good publications about Backbone.js, I'll try to summarize the outcome of this reading.

If you're not into reading technical books, this one is less than 200 pages, and should probably be renamed "Backbone.js for the impatient". I guess that's a good point, at least for me (I don't like reading technical books). In overall, I had pleasure reading this book which has a correct balance between text and code snippets. However, as I'm already using Backbone for a while, I had to skip a lot of content to find interesting topics, that the book wasn't at last developing so much. I bookmarked these individual topics and grabbed much more about them online.

I could see a possible downside of this form-factor: beginners might get frustrated from not being given enough instructions, while experienced developers would step through the entire book looking for advanced knowledge without finding any. To reassure both audiences: there's enough written to put a beginner on tracks with a working Backbone app running on top of a Node.js server, and there are enough tips and tricks for the advanced developer whether he accepts to filter what he already knows.
