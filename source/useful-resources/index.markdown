Looking for a specific resource? Here you'll find a bunch of links and documents I found during my study and which I wholeheartedly recommend.

This will be filled up with new resources as soon as I discover them, and I'll try to add the relevant symbols to help you track changes on this page.

Please don't hesitate to suggest me your own links by sending me an email! I'll make a careful review of your posts. Of course, not all links are to be published, but I'll assuredly put the best-of below.

###### Introduction to Signal Processing


We start with a really good man, Sophocle Orfanidis, which is Associate Professor at the Rutgers University of New Jersey. He wrote several very good papers about signal processing. For every beginner, "Introduction to Signal Processing" is a must read. The copyrights were transferred back to their author in 2009, so you can now download your copy for free at [http://eceweb1.rutgers.edu/~orfanidi/intro2sp/](http://eceweb1.rutgers.edu/~orfanidi/intro2sp/)


By the way, here is our big guy's homepage: [http://www.ece.rutgers.edu/faculty/orfanidis](http://www.ece.rutgers.edu/faculty/orfanidis)


###### Modern C++ Design / C++ Coding standards


Every C++ developer should know about Andrei Alexandrescu and its excellent book "Modern C++ Design: Generic Programming and Design Patterns Applied". A very good read to learn *a lot* about trait / policies classes, and effecient coding using C++ templates. Grab your paperback edition from a local retailer.


Since this is an advanced reading, beginners may prefer reading "C++ coding standards", which sums the coding habits that every developer should follow.


Here is Andrei's blog: [http://erdani.com/](http://erdani.com/)
